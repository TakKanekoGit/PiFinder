README: IMU support prototyping
===============================

> This README is temporary during the prototyping phase of the IMU support.

# Installation & set up

## Create a conda environment

We need to install additional Python packages for the changes by creating a conda environment.

```
cd ~/PiFinder/python
conda env create -f environment_imu.yml
conda activate pifinder_imu
```
