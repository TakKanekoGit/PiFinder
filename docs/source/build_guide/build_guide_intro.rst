Introduction and Overview
-------------------------

Welcome to the PiFinder build guide!  This guide is split into three main parts, one for building the `UI Board <build_guide_ui.md>`_ with Screen and Buttons, a section related to `3d printing <build_guide_parts.md>`_ and preparing the case parts, and one for `final assembly <build_guide_assembly.md>`_.   Along with these sections, please consult the `Bill of Materials <./BOM.md>`_ for a full list of parts required and reach out with any questions via `email <mailto:info@pifinder.io>`_ or `discord <https://discord.gg/Nk5fHcAtWD>`_

If you've received a kit with an assembled UI Board + 3d Parts, you can jump right to the `final assembly <build_guide_assembly.md>`_.  Otherwise, fire up that 3d printer and get the `parts printing <build_guide_parts.md>`_ while you work to assemble the `UI Board <build_guide_ui.md>`_
