## Introduction and Overview

Welcome to the PiFinder build guide!  This guide is split into three main parts, one for building the [UI Board](build_guide_ui.md) with Screen and Buttons, a section related to [3d printing](build_guide_parts.md) and preparing the case parts, and one for [final assembly](build_guide_assembly.md).   Along with these sections, please consult the [Bill of Materials](./BOM.md) for a full list of parts required and reach out with any questions via [email](mailto:info@pifinder.io) or [discord](https://discord.gg/Nk5fHcAtWD)

If you've received a kit with an assembled UI Board + 3d Parts, you can jump right to the [final assembly](build_guide_assembly.md).  Otherwise, fire up that 3d printer and get the [parts printing](build_guide_parts.md) while you work to assemble the [UI Board](build_guide_ui.md)
