the RASC Double Stars Observing Program. It encourages observers to view a variety of doubles and multi-star systems.

The 110 double star targets are visible from the northern hemisphere in many constellations.
The list should present few difficulties for observers between north latitudes 40 to 50.
The program can be started at any time and can be easily completed within 12 months.
