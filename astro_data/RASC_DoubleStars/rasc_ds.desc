the RASC Double Stars Observing Program.

The 110 double star targets are visible from the northern hemisphere in many constellations.
The list should present few difficulties for observers between north latitudes 40 to 50.
The program can be started at any time and easily completed within 12 months.

It encourages intermediate visual observers to view a variety of doubles and multi-star systems.
